## 2026-05-24 - [Missing Authorization in Peskids Portal API]
**Vulnerability:** Multiple endpoints under `apps/api/app/api/peskids/portal/[tenantSlug]/` were exposed without any authentication or authorization checks. Anyone with the `tenantSlug` (which is often public or predictable) could read and modify tenant-specific data, including form definitions, submissions, and webhook configurations.
**Learning:** New functional areas (like Peskids) were implemented using Next.js 15 Route Handlers but didn't consistently apply the established multi-tenant security patterns (`runTrustedPortalDalForPathSlug`) used in other parts of the `apps/api`. This likely happened during rapid MVP development where security wrappers were overlooked.
**Prevention:** Always use the `runTrustedPortalDalForPathSlug` (or similar) wrapper for any route that includes a `[tenantSlug]` or `[slug]` parameter in the portal API. Add a lint rule or a CI check to flag routes under `portal/` that don't use the trusted DAL wrappers.

## 2026-05-27 - [Hardcoded Audit Actors in Peskids API]
**Vulnerability:** Several sensitive operations (exports, webhooks, bulk-grading) in the Peskids Portal API used a hardcoded string ('teacher') as the actor ID in audit logs instead of the actual authenticated user's ID.
**Learning:** Even when security wrappers like `runTrustedPortalDalForPathSlug` are used, functional modules might still implement "security theater" by hardcoding metadata in audit trails, which defeats the purpose of non-repudiation.
**Prevention:** Always extract and use `session.user.id` (or equivalent) for audit logging. Perform a cross-module audit of `log_audit_event` calls to ensure real actor IDs are being captured.

## 2026-06-04 - [Missing Authorization in Mission Control Admin Endpoints]
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/admin/mission-control/orchestrator` and `/api/admin/mission-control/teams` endpoints were missing any authentication or authorization checks. They exposed sensitive internal data like Redis queue lengths and worker configurations.
**Learning:** High-level administrative dashboards sometimes omit security checks when they are assumed to be "internal-only," but in a web context, every route must be explicitly protected.
**Prevention:** Audit all routes under `app/api/admin/` to ensure they call `requireAdminAccess`. Use a shared template or linting tool to enforce mandatory authorization calls in the `GET/POST` handlers.
