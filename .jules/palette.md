## 2026-05-26 - Accessible Form Pattern
**Learning:** Standard HTML forms in the marketplace were missing explicit associations between labels and inputs, making them difficult for screen reader users to navigate.
**Action:** Always use `htmlFor` on `<label>` and a matching `id` on form controls (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`) to ensure the accessible name is correctly associated.

## 2025-05-22 - Toggle Visibility for Sensitive Data
**Learning:** Providing a toggle to hide revealed credentials (like passwords) is a fundamental UX pattern that prevents users from being forced to wait for an auto-hide timer, improving both privacy and user control.
**Action:** Implement toggle visibility (Eye/EyeOff icons) for all sensitive credential reveal components.

## 2025-05-22 - Root Dependency Overrides for Monorepo Stability
**Learning:** In a monorepo, inconsistent versions of foundational libraries like `undici` can break test environments (e.g., `jsdom` in Vitest).
**Action:** Use root `package.json` overrides to align critical dependencies across all workspaces when version mismatches occur.

## 2026-06-16 - Reusable Credential Copy Pattern
**Learning:** A reusable UX pattern for sensitive data (e.g., passwords in `CredentialReveal`) includes providing a 'Copy' button alongside visibility toggles, using a 2-second visual confirmation (Check icon + 'Copiado' text) to reduce friction.
**Action:** Always provide a one-click copy option for credentials to avoid manual selection errors.
