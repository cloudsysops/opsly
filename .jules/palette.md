**Action:** Implement toggle visibility (Eye/EyeOff icons) for all sensitive credential reveal components.

**Learning:** In a monorepo, inconsistent versions of foundational libraries like `undici` can break test environments (e.g., `jsdom` in Vitest).
**Action:** Use root `package.json` overrides to align critical dependencies across all workspaces when version mismatches occur.
